NOTES CILIANI


- Exercise 7: how everything fits together
Study the .ts, .css and .html files generated by Vite (they will be in your project directory).
Try to understand what’s going on there. Some questions to help you understand the files:

1) How are the files connected together?
index.html acts as the entry point of the page, it contains the root element (such as <div id="app"></div>) and loads the application by importing the main TypeScript module with <script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script>.
The file main.ts is the ES-module entry point that Vite uses to start the application. From there, it imports other .ts files through normal ES module import/export statements, and it also imports the CSS file (for example import "./style.css";).
Because the CSS is imported directly into main.ts, it does not need to be linked in the HTML; Vite automatically bundles and injects it.

2) What method is used in the script files to retrieve and alter the HTML element?
To retrieve and modify HTML elements, the script files use standard DOM APIs, typically document.querySelector() to access the root element by its selector.
Once selected, the element is updated by modifying properties such as innerHTML or textContent, or by creating and appending elements programmatically.


- Exercise 8: creating types
I completed all six exercises directly in TypeScript, not in JavaScript. Therefore, the file I produced is already a .ts file.
